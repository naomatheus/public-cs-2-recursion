# Recursion

## Overview
This lesson introduced the wonders of recursion. Matt Robinson completed this in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (June 2019)

There were two components to this lesson:
1. [myGA module: Recursion](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/773)
2. [In-Class Exercise: Writing Recursive Functions](exercises/recursion.js)

## Learning Outcomes

- Define recursion. 
- Write the base case and recursive cases of a recursive function. 
- Identify functions that use recursion and explain why itâ€™s used.

## Duration
1.5 hours total:
* 0.5 hour myGA
* 1 hour in class
* Uncountable hours outside of class

## Prerequisites
* Big O Notation
